### Problem Statement

#
  

A computer algorithm is a sequence of finite instructions that carry out a series of processes to answer certain problems.

The ability to program computers is one of the necessary foundations of any computer science professional. But above and beyond the level of programming, the fundamental characteristic of a computer science professional is his or her ability to solve problems. 

Solving real-life computer problems involves much more than just programming - skills that distinguish an engineer from a simple programmer. It implies understanding and analyzing the needs of the problems, knowing how to model them in an abstract way differentiating the important from the irrelevant, having a wide range of conceptual tools that can be applied in their resolution, translating an abstract design into a concrete language and environment and, finally, being able to evaluate the correctness, performance and possible drawbacks of the proposed solution.
